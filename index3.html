Creating cross platform replication of S3 - Azure has an API which links the access key and secret key which links to AWS

clone s3fs-fuse repo 
install aws cli on Linux (google)
default output format - table

---------Hosting static website-----------------
inside buckets -> properties -> edit static website->enable -> copy link
index.html
save
will get a url
go to object
add folder
select all website files inside bucket -> actions -> make public using ACLs

go to permissions of bucket -> enable ACLs -> save
select entire objects -> actions -> make public acl

-----------share data with someone---------------
select bucket-> properties -> object lock-> edit requester pay -> money will be paid by the other user

bucket versioning under permissions -> enable
if we delete the objects
show versions -> deleted file will be shown with delete marker -> deleted file's downloadable link will be available.

-----------------Cross region replication-------------------
CRR is asynchronous 
Versioning should be enabled in both the region's bucket
100 buckets in free tier acc
64 petabyte inside each bucket
5 elastic IPs in free tier -> in each region

select bucket -> management -> replication rule
source object -> apply to all
source will be virginia
select create new role in IAM
choose rule scope -> apply all
choose bucket
change storage class -> intelligent tiering
choose ohio as destination
replicate
add file
refresh in ohio

-----------Lifecycle confg----------------------
inside management
lifecycle rule -> first one
add transition current versions - 3

----------------------Load Balancer-----------------
ELB - manual load balancer
3 types of LBs - network, classic and application
F5 is a hardware based load balancer
if there will be 4 servers - dedicated url will be given - all servers will be added behind that server
uses round robin.
if a server gets crashes - it will be automatically get deleted from the target group.
create 4 VMs - 4 different data
create cross zoned VMs
port 80 should be allowed
install apache in all the machines
# yum install httpd -y
# cd /vat/www/html
# echo "jhdjdhjdh" > index.html
# ll
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd
yum install curl
curl http://localhost

in M2(redhat)
dnf install httpd -y

in M3

apt update -y
apt install apache2 -y

add all the servers into target groups
create target groups
instances
target group name
make it
register targets
select all vms
include 80
create target group

load balancer
create application load balancer
under AZs
select first 4
select sec group
under default
select target group - select the one which was made in target group
listening port 80

auto balancing automatically creates elastic 

------------auto scaling-----------------
as per our workload, we can add servers horizontally
manual scaling, dynamic scaling, scheduled scaling
after defining policies -> aws automatically configures everything.
application's auto scaling is created
launch template
give name
choose ami
first one
instance type - t3.micro
key pair
network settings - us-east-1a
sec group
advanced det
add !bin/bash texts
create template

create auti scaling group
give name
launch template - existing one
vpc
us-east-1-b-c-d
balanced best effort
next

attach a new (third one)
internet facing
vpc first one
health checks -> turn on first and last
select target
next
desired capacity -> 2
min desired - 1
max desired - 2
under automatic scaling - optional -> select target tracking
target value - 75
target cpu
instance warmup - 180
next
next
create

can check in auto scaling groups
